16/06/2020 OsiXpr
  - added functionality for switching between dual and primal simplex with hints
  - implemented getDualRays
  - implemented getBasisStatus

20/05/2020 OsiMsk
  - protect change in numInstances_ global variable by mutex if C++ 11 or higher, see #135

11/05/2020 OsiMsk
  - increase maximal number of nonzeros in addCols and addRows only if necessary, see #134

24/03/2020 OsiCpx
  - fixed coltype not being allocated when loading a problem via matrix
    that has no rows, see #129

Mar/2020 OsiSolverInterface
 - added the new conflict graph structure: attribute cgraph_ and methods getCGraph and setCGraph.

Jan/2020 Buildsystem
 - Larger renovation of the build system and elimination of root directory.
   As a consequence, a monolithic build of Osi, which builds Osi with
   all its dependencies in one run of configure and make is no longer
   possible. Dependencies should now be build and installed before
   building Osi.
   - Removed svn:externals. CoinUtils now needs to be build and installed
     in advance.
   - When using a GCC-compatible compiler, the Osi interface
     functions are now declared with `visibility(default)`-attribute,
     thus building Osi with `-fvisibility=hidden` still produces a
     usable library.
   - When using a MSVC-compatible compiler, Osi interface functions
     are now declared with `dllimport`-attribute, so that a Osi C++ DLL
     can be used.
   - Under Windows/Msys2, DLLs are now build by default.
   - Cygwin and MSys1 are no longer supported.
   - pkg-config is now mandatory. On Windows, make sure to use a
     pkg-config version that produces Unix-style paths.
   - "Addlibs" files have been removed, pkg-config should be used instead.
   - Script "compile" is now used to wrap around calls of cl/icl/ifort
     and translate GCC-style compiler flags to MSVC style.
   - Header files are now installed in the better named
     `$prefix/include/coin-or` instead of `$prefix/include/coin`.
   - The default for `--prefix` is no longer the build directory, but
     the autotools-default, probably `/usr/local`.
   - `--enable-debug` does not imply `--disable-shared` anymore.
   - Removed `--enable-debug-osi`, use `--enable-debug` instead.
   - Removed configure variables OPT/DBG_C/CXXFLAGS. Use C/CXXFLAGS instead.
   - Silent build output is now enabled by default, use configure
     flag `--disable-silent-rules` or call make with `V=1` to disable.
   - Also for static builds, PIC objects are now generated by default,
     use `--without-pic` to disable.
   - The `--with-*-incdir` and `--with-*-lib` configure flags have been
     replaced by corresponding `--with-*-cflags` and `--with-*-lflags`
     flags. Note that the include directories need to be specified
     via `-I<dir>` in `--with-*-cflags`.
