Prerequisites for installation:
- at the moment on (*)nix platforms you must use g++ 2.95.2 or higher.
- must use gnu make
- to make the documentation doxygen must be installed

Targets are put in subdirectories, whose name is derived from the
platform name (as returned by `uname`) and the optimization level
(e.g., Linux-g).

To build Osi library and unitTest
  - read and edit the top of Makefile to select
      - whether shared or static library should be built
      - optimization level
      - where the compiled library should be installed
      - which solvers you want to compile in.
        If you want to use the Volume Algorithm as a solver then first
        you must build and install libvol. See Vol/INSTALL in the COIN
        root directory.
  - 'make' to build and install the library.
  - 'make unitTest' to create the unitTest program. It will be placed
    in the target subdirectory.

  - 'make doc' to create the html documentation of the classes in the
    library and place them in doc/html.

To run Osi unitTest
  - ./TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY/unitTest
    where TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY is the name of the subdirectory
    containing the unitTest executable.
