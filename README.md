Osi (*O*pen *S*olver *I*nterface) provides an abstract base class to a generic linear programming (LP) solver, along with derived classes for specific solvers.
Many applications may be able to use the Osi to insulate themselves from a specific LP solver.
That is, programs written to the OSI standard may be linked to any solver with an OSI interface and should produce correct results.
The OSI has been significantly extended compared to its first incarnation.
Currently, the OSI supports linear programming solvers and has rudimentary support for integer programming.
Among others the following operations are supported:
 * creating the LP formulation;
 * directly modifying the formulation by adding rows/columns;
 * modifying the formulation by adding cutting planes provided by [CGL](https://www.github.com/coin-or/Cgl);
 * solving the formulation (and resolving after modifications);
 * extracting solution information;
 * invoking the underlying solver's branch-and-bound component.

The following is a list of derived Osi classes:

|[XPRESS-MP](https://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization)|OsiXpr| |

Each solver interface is in a separate directory of Osi or distributed
with the solver itself.

Within COIN-OR, Osi is used by [Cgl](https://www.github.com/coin-or/Cgl), [Cbc](https://www.github.com/coin-or/Cbc), and [Bcp](https://www.github.com/coin-or/Bcp), among others.

The main project managers are Lou Hafer (@LouHafer) and Matt Saltzmann (@mjsaltzman).

An incomplete list of recent changes to Osi are found in the [CHANGELOG](Osi/CHANGELOG)

## DOWNLOAD

What follows is a quick start guide for obtaining or building
Osi on common platforms. More detailed information is
available [here](https://coin-or.github.io/user_introduction.html).

### Docker image

There is a Docker image that provides Osi, as well as other projects
in the [COIN-OR Optimization
Suite](https://github.com/coin-or/COIN-OR-OptimizationSuite) [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/coinor/coin-or-optimization-suite)

### Binaries

For newer releases, binaries will be made available as assets attached to
releases in Github
[here](https://github.com/coin-or/Osi/releases). Older binaries
are archived as part of Cbc
[here](https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Cbc).

 * *Linux* (see https://repology.org/project/coin-or-osi/versions for a complete listing): 
   * arch:
     ```
     $ sudo pacman -S  coin-or-osi
     ```
   * Debian/Ubuntu:
     ```
     $ sudo apt-get install  coinor-osi coinor-libosi-dev
     ```
   * Fedora/Redhat/CentOS:
     ```
     $ sudo yum install  coin-or-Osi coin-or-Osi-devel
     ```
   * freebsd:
     ```
     $ sudo pkg install math/osi
     ```
   * linuxbrew:
     ```
     $ brew install osi
     ```
 * *Windows*: The easiest way to get Osi on Windows is to download an archive as described above.
 * *Mac OS X*: The easiest way to get Osi on Mac OS X is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
     ```
     $ brew tap coin-or-tools/coinor
     $ brew install coin-or-tools/coinor/osi
     ```

* *conda* (cross-platform, no Windows for now):
     ```
     $ conda install coin-or-osi
     ```

Due to license incompatibilities, pre-compiled binaries lack some 
functionality. If binaries are not available for your platform for the latest 
version and you would like to request them to be built and posted, feel free 
to let us know on the mailing list. 

### Source

Source code can be obtained either by

 * Downloading a snapshot of the source code for the latest release version of Osi from the
 [releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Osi/releases) page,
 * Cloning this repository from [Github](https://github.com/coin-or/Osi), or 
 * Using the [coinbrew](https://github.com/coin-or/coinbrew) script to get the project and all dependencies (recommended, see below).   

### Dependencies

Osi has a number of dependencies, which are detailed in
[config.yml](.coin-or/config.yml). Dependencies on other COIN-OR projects are
automatically downloaded when obtaining the source with `coinbrew`. For some
of the remaining third-party dependencies, automatic download scripts and
build wrappers are provided (and will also be automatically run for required
and recommended dependencies), while other libraries that are aeasy to obtain
must be installed using an appropriate package manager (or may come with your
OS by default). 

## BUILDING from source

These quick start instructions assume you are in a bash shell. 

### Using `coinbrew`

To download and build Osi from source, execute the 
following on the command line. 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coin-or/coinbrew/master/coinbrew
chmod u+x coinbrew
./coinbrew fetch Osi@master
./coinbrew build Osi
```
For more detailed instructions on coinbrew, see https://coin-or.github.io/coinbrew.
The `coinbrew` script will fetch the additional projects specified in the Dependencies section of [config.yml](.coin-or/config.yml).

### Without `coinbrew` (Expert users)

 * Download the source code, e.g., by cloning the git repo https://github.com/coin-or/Osi
 * Download and install the source code for the dependencies listed in [config.yml](.coin-or/config.yml)
 * Build the code as follows (make sure to set PKG_CONFIG_PTH to install directory for dependencies).

```
./configure -C
make
make test
make install
```

## Doxygen Documentation

If you have `Doxygen` available, you can build a HTML documentation by typing

`make doxygen-docs` 

in the build directory. If Osi was built via `coinbrew`, then the build
directory will be `./build/Osi/master` by default. The doxygen documentation main file
is found at `<build-dir>/doxydoc/html/index.html`.

If you don't have `doxygen` installed locally, you can use also find the
documentation [here](http://coin-or.github.io/Osi/Doxygen).

## Dynamically loading commercial solver libraries

### At build time

It is possible to create an osi build that supports cplex, gurobi and xpress even if you don't have (yet) any of these solvers on your machine using [lazylpsolverlibs](https://code.google.com/p/lazylpsolverlibs/). To do so, follow these steps:

 1. Install lazylpsolverlibs (follow the instructions of the [lazylpsolverlibs wiki](https://code.google.com/p/lazylpsolverlibs/wiki/HowToSetup))
 2. Use the following command line to configure Osi:
```
./configure --with-cplex-incdir="$(pkg-config --variable=includedir lazycplex)/lazylpsolverlibs/ilcplex" \
            --with-cplex-lib="$(pkg-config --libs lazycplex)" \ 
            --with-gurobi-incdir="$(pkg-config --variable=includedir lazygurobi)/lazylpsolverlibs" \
            --with-gurobi-lib="$(pkg-config --libs lazygurobi)" \
            --with-xpress-incdir="$(pkg-config --variable=includedir lazyxprs)/lazylpsolverlibs" \
            --with-xpress-lib="$(pkg-config --libs lazyxprs)"
```
 3. Then follow the normal installation process (make, make install)

### At run time

Your build should now support cplex, gurobi and xpress, which means that if you install one of these solvers, osi will be able to use it.
At run time, you just need to point one of the environment variables LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_GUROBI_LIB, LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_CPLEX_LIB or LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_XPRS_LIB to the full path of the corresponding solver library.
For example:
```
export LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_CPLEX_LIB=/usr/ilog/cplex121/bin/x86_debian4.0_4.1/libcplex121.so
```

### Troubleshooting

If pkg-config reports errors during the configure step, try modifying the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable. Most likely, you need to do:
```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
```
