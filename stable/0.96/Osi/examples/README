These examples are from the OSI tutorial at INFORMS Atlanta 2003 by
Brady Hunsaker and the workshop section on OSI given by Matthew
Saltzman at CORS/INFORMS Banff 2004.

To build each program, adjust the COIN_DIR macro in Makefile.<program>
and invoke

	make -f Makefile.<program>

where <program> is the name of the program to build.  The accompanying
slides and handouts can be found at

---------------

If "make" is failing with link time errors when building in the cygwin environment 
then try changing the line
   CXX := g++
to be
   CXX := g++ -mno-cygwin
in the file Makefile.<program>
